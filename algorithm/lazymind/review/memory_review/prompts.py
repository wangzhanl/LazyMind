MEMORY_REVIEW_PROMPT = (
    "# Task\n"
    "Review the conversation history and decide whether to propose one durable update to memory or user profile.\n"
    "Make at most one memory_editor call. If nothing is worth saving, reply exactly `Nothing to save` with a brief reason.\n\n"
    "# Available Targets\n"
    "- memory: concise agent working-memory notes about the user's ongoing work, what was discussed, and future-relevant session context.\n"
    "- user_preference: stable user profile/preferences such as identity, role, preferred name, communication tone, language preference, output format, level of detail, and taboos.\n"
    "Choose the single most appropriate target for any durable update. Do not duplicate one fact across both targets.\n\n"
    "# What to Save or Skip\n"
    "- Save memory only for important, non-obvious session facts the agent may need later; prefer sparse, high-signal memory. When in doubt, do not save memory.\n"
    "- Save user profile content when the user explicitly states a stable preference, identity, role, preferred name, or communication rule.\n"
    "- Skip trivial, obvious, or purely temporary details, such as `I'm tired today`.\n"
    "- Do NOT save multi-step reusable workflows, troubleshooting procedures, lessons learned, tool usage patterns, implementation recipes, SOPs, or task-specific conventions as memory or user profile content. Those belong outside this endpoint; reply `Nothing to save` if that is the only durable information.\n\n"
    "# Existing State and Conflict Rules\n"
    "- Read the EXISTING STATE before writing.\n"
    "- Base operations on the selected target's existing content; do NOT propose a blind rewrite from scratch.\n"
    "- Retain all still-valid existing entries and keep the existing structure/format unless a change is necessary.\n"
    "- Add new content only for newly discovered durable facts or explicit updates to older content.\n"
    "- If new information conflicts with existing content, the new information takes precedence unless the user explicitly says it is temporary.\n"
    "- Move or remove a fact only when it is clearly outdated, wrong, duplicated, or stored in the wrong target.\n\n"
    "# Language\n"
    "- Determine the language of new or rewritten memory/user profile content from the selected target's existing content and the conversation history.\n"
    "- If the selected target already has content, preserve that language unless the user explicitly asks for another language.\n"
    "- If the selected target is empty, use the dominant language of the user's messages in the conversation history; Chinese user messages should produce Chinese memory/user profile content.\n"
    "- Apply this to `replace_text.new` and `replace_all.content`; do not switch to English just because these instructions are written in English.\n\n"
    "# User Profile Format\n"
    "- When target='user_preference', the edited full text must use YAML frontmatter delimited by `---`, followed by Markdown body content.\n"
    "- The YAML frontmatter must contain at least these fields: agent_persona, preferred_name, response_style.\n"
    "- Required opening shape:\n"
    "  ---\n"
    "  agent_persona: \"<agent identity, responsibilities, and boundaries>\"\n"
    "  preferred_name: \"<how replies should address the user>\"\n"
    "  response_style: \"<expression, length, and structure preference>\"\n"
    "  ---\n"
    "- agent_persona（智能体身份、职责和边界）describes the identity, responsibilities, and boundaries the agent should maintain when replying.\n"
    "- preferred_name（对用户的称呼方式）means how replies should address the user.\n"
    "- response_style（表达习惯、篇幅和结构偏好）is a short text describing expression habits, length preference, and structure preference.\n"
    "- Each YAML frontmatter value must be a string of 100 characters or less.\n"
    "- Use \"\" when agent_persona, preferred_name, or response_style is unknown. If response_style is missing or invalid during format repair and the user did not specify one, use \"\".\n"
    "- Modify agent_persona, preferred_name, or response_style only when the user explicitly asks to change that specific field or clearly states the corresponding stable preference.\n"
    "- If the durable update is an ordinary user profile/preference, keep existing frontmatter values unchanged and write the new information in the Markdown body.\n"
    "- Write concrete user profile/preference body content after the closing `---`; never use generic acknowledgement text such as \"preference recorded\" as the body.\n"
    "- If the current user profile is empty, legacy/free-form, or missing this required frontmatter, use replace_all to rewrite the whole user profile into the frontmatter-plus-body format.\n"
    "- When using replace_all for target='user_preference', you MUST preserve all existing frontmatter field names exactly as they appear in the current user profile; only change their values when the user explicitly requests. Never drop, rename, or invent a frontmatter key. If new information does not fit an existing frontmatter field, write it in the Markdown body.\n"
    "- If using replace_text for target='user_preference', ensure the final rendered text still has frontmatter and Markdown body.\n\n"
    "# Tool Contract\n"
    "- Use only memory_editor; do not call any other tool.\n"
    "- memory_editor requires exactly target and operations.\n"
    "- For agent working memory, call memory_editor(target='memory', operations=[...]).\n"
    "- For user profile/preferences, call memory_editor(target='user_preference', operations=[...]).\n"
    "- Supported operation: replace_text: {\"op\": \"replace_text\", \"old\": \"...\", \"new\": \"...\"}; `old` MUST be an exact substring copied from the selected target's current content.\n"
    "- Supported operation: replace_all: {\"op\": \"replace_all\", \"content\": \"...\"}; `content` is the full replacement text for the selected target.\n"
    "- Prefer replace_text with exact old text copied from the selected target's existing content.\n"
    "- Use replace_all only when the selected target is empty, no exact substring can safely anchor the edit, or the content needs global deduplication/conflict resolution/reorganization.\n"
    "- For adding one item to non-empty content, replace the smallest exact existing section or block with the same block plus the new item.\n"
    "- The operations are applied to the selected target content below, and the edited full text is written to the memory_review table for human review.\n"
    "- If no durable update is warranted, do not call memory_editor; reply with `Nothing to save` and a brief reason."
