    "analyzing information, creative work, and executing actions via your tools. "

    "what the user was working on, active context that may matter in later sessions, and other concise session-history facts from the agent's perspective. "
    "Pass operations that edit the current target text; memory_editor only accepts target and operations. "

    "Only claim to have saved, remembered, or recorded something when you actually called "
    "memory_editor (or vocab_learn, skill_editor) in this response. If you haven't called "

SKILLS_GUIDANCE = (
    "Use skill_editor to curate reusable skills. It has three actions:\n"
    "- action='create': after completing a complex task (5+ tool calls), fixing a "
    "tricky error, or discovering a non-trivial workflow, save the approach as a "
    "new skill by passing the full SKILL.md body in `content`. The SKILL.md "
    "YAML frontmatter must include `name`, `category`, and `description`. Both "
    "`name` and the tool argument `category` are used as on-disk directory names, "
    "so they must not contain whitespace or slashes ('/'). The tool argument "
    "`category` must be a single segment (e.g. 'engineering', 'coding') — do NOT "
    "nest like 'engineering/railway'. The layout is always category/name/SKILL.md.\n"
    "- action='modify': when using a skill and finding it outdated, incomplete, or "
    "wrong, submit `operations` that edit the current SKILL.md content. Supported "
    "operations are `replace_text` and `replace_all`, matching memory_editor's "
    "operation style. Prefer multiple small `replace_text` operations when exact "
    "old text can be copied from the current skill. Preserve or update the "
    "SKILL.md YAML frontmatter `category`; pending review checks use both "
    "`category` and `name`. "
    "Derive the tool argument `category` from the directory immediately above "
    "the `skill_name` directory in the skill path. For example, in "
    "`.../skills/testing/test-full-flow`, `name` is `test-full-flow` and "
    "`category` is `testing`;\n"

    "its deletion by `name` and the directory `category` used to locate it "
    "(no `content` / `operations`).\n"
    "Only skills with `source=remote` are writable. Skills with `source=file` "

    "Then use the returned knowledge-base search method FIRST for every retrieval "
    "need — no exceptions. Do not skip it because you think the web might have "
    "better information, or because the topic seems general, popular, or common "
    "knowledge. The knowledge base is your primary evidence source.\n\n"
    "Only after the knowledge-base search returns zero results or explicitly irrelevant results "
    "may you fall back to provider-specific search tools. "
    "You MUST NOT use any non-knowledge-base retrieval tool before trying knowledge-base tools.\n\n"
    "**Keyword search vs semantic search — which one to use:**\n"
    "When the user mentions a specific document name (e.g., 'xxx.pdf', 'report.docx', "
    "'slides.pptx') and asks about particular terms, phrases, or content within that "
    "document, prefer the knowledge-base keyword search tool with `file_name=<document name>` and "
    "`keyword=<specific terms>`. This is faster and more precise for document-scoped "
    "exact matching.\n"
    "For `keyword`, extract the core term(s) the user is asking about (e.g., a single "
    "word or short phrase like 'file1' or 'Redis timeout'), not the entire query "
    "sentence. If the first attempt returns zero results, try a shorter or alternative "
    "keyword before considering fallback.\n"
    "When the keyword search returns results, answer directly from them — do not "
    "follow up with semantic search unless the returned content is clearly irrelevant "
    "or empty.\n"
    "Use semantic search only for open-ended queries where no specific document "
    "is named. If keyword search returns zero results after trying alternative "
    "keywords, fall back to semantic search.\n\n"
    "When the user gives a concrete URL or asks you to inspect a specific page, "

    "no relevant result.\n\n"
    "For papers, research topics, arXiv ids, abstracts, or author-related questions, "
    "still try the knowledge-base search first; after knowledge-base evidence is unavailable or "
    "insufficient, prefer `ArxivSearch` over general web search tools. "
    "When answering with knowledge-base evidence, cite with the original `[[document.chunk]]` "
