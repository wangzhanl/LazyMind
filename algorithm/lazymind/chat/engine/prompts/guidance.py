    "If a knowledge-base tool group is available, you MUST activate it first by calling "
    "its activation tool (e.g. `get_KBToolGroup_methods`) before using any of its search methods. "
    "Then use the returned knowledge-base search method FIRST for every retrieval "
    "need — no exceptions. Do not skip it because you think the web might have "
    "better information, or because the topic seems general, popular, or common "
    "knowledge. The knowledge base is your primary evidence source.\n\n"
    "Only after the knowledge-base search returns zero results or explicitly irrelevant results "
    "may you fall back to provider-specific search tools. "
    "You MUST NOT use any non-knowledge-base retrieval tool before trying knowledge-base tools.\n\n"
    "**Keyword search vs semantic search — which one to use:**\n"
    "When the user mentions a specific document name (e.g., 'xxx.pdf', 'report.docx', "
    "'slides.pptx') and asks about particular terms, phrases, or content within that "
    "document, prefer the knowledge-base keyword search tool with `file_name=<document name>` and "
    "`keyword=<specific terms>`. This is faster and more precise for document-scoped "
    "exact matching.\n"
    "For `keyword`, extract the core term(s) the user is asking about (e.g., a single "
    "word or short phrase like 'file1' or 'Redis timeout'), not the entire query "
    "sentence. If the first attempt returns zero results, try a shorter or alternative "
    "keyword before considering fallback.\n"
    "When the keyword search returns results, answer directly from them — do not "
    "follow up with semantic search unless the returned content is clearly irrelevant "
    "or empty.\n"
    "Use semantic search only for open-ended queries where no specific document "
    "is named. If keyword search returns zero results after trying alternative "
    "keywords, fall back to semantic search.\n\n"
    "When the user gives a concrete URL or asks you to inspect a specific page, "
    "still try the knowledge-base search first; use `url_fetch` only when the knowledge base has "
    "no relevant result.\n\n"
    "For papers, research topics, arXiv ids, abstracts, or author-related questions, "
    "still try the knowledge-base search first; after knowledge-base evidence is unavailable or "
    "insufficient, prefer `ArxivSearch` over general web search tools. "
    "When answering with knowledge-base evidence, cite with the original `[[document.chunk]]` "
    "markers. When answering with web search tools, `url_fetch`, "
