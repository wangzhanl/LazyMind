    "new skill by passing the full SKILL.md body in `content`. Both `name` and "
    "`category` are used as on-disk directory names, so they must not contain "
    "whitespace or slashes ('/'). `category` must be a single segment "
    "(e.g. 'engineering', 'coding') — do NOT nest like 'engineering/railway'. "

    "- action='modify': when using a skill and finding it outdated, incomplete, or "
    "wrong, submit targeted edit proposals via `suggestions` (natural-language, "
    "max 5 per call). Existing skills are identified by the pair (`category`, `name`), "
    "not by `name` alone. Derive `category` from the directory immediately above "
    "the `skill_name` directory in the skill path. For example, in "
    "`.../skills/testing/test-full-flow`, `name` is `test-full-flow` and "
